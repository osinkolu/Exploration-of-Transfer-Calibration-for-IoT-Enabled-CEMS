Welcome to the IoT-Based Emissions Monitoring System repository! This project is a spinoff from the chemotronix project and aims to develop a low-cost, real-time emissions monitoring system using IoT devices, machine learning, and decentralized data storage. The system allows for accurate and continuous monitoring of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, contributing to environmental sustainability efforts.

## Introduction
Air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions are critical environmental concerns. Our project focuses on creating an innovative emissions monitoring solution using IoT technologies. This system includes sensor calibration for precise data, predicting CO2 emissions, and exploring the transfer of calibration between devices.

## Folder Structure
The repository is organized into six major folders:
1. **API**: Contains the code for the application programming interface, enabling communication with the IoT devices and hosted ML model for calibration.
2. **Data Lake**: Holds the data storage system, where emissions data are stored and accessible.
3. **IoT design**: This folder contains the design specifications and configuration files for the IoT devices used in the monitoring system.
4. **Models**: Includes machine learning models used for CO2 emission prediction and calibration transfer.
5. **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
6. **Results**: Stores images and visualizations of plots and graphs generated during the project.

## Setup
To set up the system locally, follow the instructions in the respective folders. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed and the IoT devices configured correctly.

## Usage
The system is designed to be user-friendly. After the setup, start the API and connect the IoT devices to begin real-time emissions monitoring. Data will be stored in the Data Lake for further analysis.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions from the community to enhance this emissions monitoring system. Feel free to submit bug reports, feature requests, or pull requests to help us make a positive impact on the environment together.
